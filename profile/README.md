## Co-design at UniSQ ‚úàÔ∏è

_Tools for co-design developed by UniSQ and collaborators (under construction)_

### Key Info
- This organsation holds re-usable and generic repos and packages used in the development of co-design and MDO toolchains.
- It is _not_ the place for spefic case studies and co-design implementations. Completed and verified examples, which may be of use to new members, may be stored after discussion with Ingo and Andy
- It is currently administered by Ingo Jahn and Andy Lock,

#### Development principles
- Pease ensure Python code is formatted per PEP8. This isn't hard - tools like [Black](https://github.com/psf/black) make a lot of this a one-line command.
- Repos should be structed as `pip` packages (unless not possible), and installed as editable (`pip install -e <REPO>`)
- Avoid large branches which diverge significantly from the `main` branch. Merge frequently with each new feature to maintain capability.
- Try and include test modules for key features. We are typically poor at this, but it will be beneficial for a large and complex toolchain.
